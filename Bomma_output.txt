rendering browsers default styles element formatting Content further styled using Cascading Style Sheets CSS72Presentational markup indicates appearance regardless purposeFor example indicates visual output devices should render boldface gives little indication devices unable aural devices aloud should italic there other elements equivalent visual renderings semantic nature strong emphasized respectively easier aural agent should interpret latter elements However equivalent their presentational counterparts would undesirable screenreader emphasize instance screen would italicized presentational markup elements become deprecated under specification favor using stylingHypertext markup makes parts document links other documentsAn anchor element creates hyperlink document

several common attributes appear elements attribute provides documentwide unique identifier element identify element stylesheets alter presentational properties scripts alter animate delete contents presentation Appended provides globally unique identifier element typically subsection example Attributes httpsenwikipediaorgwikiHTMLAttributesThe class attribute provides classifying similar elements semantic presentation purposes example document might semantically designation indicate elements class value subordinate document presentation elements might gathered together presented footnotes instead appearing place where occur source Class attributes semantically microformats Multiple class values specified example element notation important classesAn author style attribute assign presentational properties particular element considered better practice elements class attributes select element within stylesheet though sometimes cumbersome simple specific stylingThe title attribute attach subtextual explanation element browsers attribute displayed tooltipThe attribute identifies natural language elements contents which different document example Englishlanguage
